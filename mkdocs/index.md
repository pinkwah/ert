Ert (Ensemble based Reservoir Tool) is a free and open-source tool for
automating complex workflows, such as uncertainty quantification and data
assimilation. It is heavily used in the petroleum industry for reservoir
management and production optimization, but Ert is a general tool and is used in
other domains, such as wind-farm management and carbon capture and storage.

If you're new to ERT:

1. Begin by ensuring you've correctly installed it.
   Check out the [Setup](setup) guide for assistance.
2. Follow the [Guide](guide) to learn how to use ERT for parameter estimation.
